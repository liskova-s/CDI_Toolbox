# CDI_Toolbox

This repository contains Matlab implementation of Coherent Diffractive Imaging (CDI) reconstruction algorithms enabling reconstructions of binary objects from far-field diffraction intensity patterns. This toolbox is a part of thesis submitted at FNSPE, Czech Technical University.

The code uses the iterative __shrinkwrap__ phase retrieval technique, which was implemented based on work by Marchesini ([X-ray image reconstruction from a diffraction pattern alone](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.68.140101))  and Fienup ([Phase retrieval algorithms: a comparison](https://doi.org/10.1364/AO.21.002758), [Reconstruction of an object from the modulus of its fourier transform](https://opg.optica.org/ol/abstract.cfm?uri=ol-3-1-27)).
